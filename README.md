# Algorithms

### Algorithmic Programming Solutions
Accepted Solutions to problems on the online judge https://code.hits.university/ while I was a software engineering student at TSU, Russia (2019-2020). It was also an opportunity to practise fundamental algorithms and data structures that are very common in Google interviews (or FAANG in general). Some code files may contain *dotted lines* as separators between different versions of accepted solutions, or simply just duplicates. The code is for the large part in C++14, but there are some solutions that were written in Python 3. The solution files are numbered according to the task's number on the online judge.

The problems are grouped under several themes. You can get access to the details of the problems by checking the problem sets file in this repository, or by signing up on https://code.hits.university/ and have access to the course through this link https://code.hits.university/classes/invitation/87881b5f-0e33-4bc6-be56-a25a890e076e .

The problems are grouped under five themes:

1) Basics of programming:

    Assignment + arithmetics 
    
    Conditions 
    
    Loops 
    
    Arrays 
    
    Strings and symbols data type 
    
    Procedures and functions 
    
    Matrix 
    
2) Search and sorting 
3) Dynamics and data structures 
4) Graphs 
5) Strings 
6) Approximate calculus
