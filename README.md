### Competitive Programming Solutions
Accepted Solutions for problems on https://ejudge.kreosoft.ru/en while I was a SWE student at TSU, Russia (2019-2020). Some code files may contain a *dotted line* as a separator between different versions of accepted solutions. The code is for the large part in C++14, but there are some solutions that were written in Python 3. The solution files are numbered according to the task's number on the online judge ejudge.

One of the best introductions https://cses.fi/problemset/list

This is by far the best course I found on Graph theory, which is my favourite of all mathematics! https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~slotag/classes/SP17/

The best book on algorithms (Ok, Yes, it beats CLRS!) http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/

A good list https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/23054
