### Algorithmic Programming Solutions
Accepted Solutions to problems on https://ejudge.kreosoft.ru/en while I was a software engineering student at TSU, Russia (2019-2020). Solving such problems was a practical training under direct professor's supervision, with awards at the end of semesters. It was also an opportunity to practise fundamental algorithms and data structures that are very common in Google interviews (or FAANG in general). Some code files may contain *dotted lines* as separators between different versions of accepted solutions, or simply just duplicates. The code is for the large part in C++14, but there are some solutions that were written in Python 3. The solution files are numbered according to the task's number on ejudge.

This collection fits for a great introduction to competitive programming for future training on Codeforces or Topcoder.
