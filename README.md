Based on a challenging course at Tomsk State University, where by the end of the first semester of the first year in the Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering program, students were expected to be able to solve tough graph theory problems. 
By the end of the first year, students were expected to be able to solve optimization problems using genetic algorithms and so on, in addition to having solved 250 problems. The problems were submitted on an online judge https://code.hits.university/. 
I was ranked among the top 10 students on the online judge.

I attach in this repo the problem description and its solution. Problems are grouped in the following way:
