### Competitive Programming Solutions
Accepted Solutions for problems on https://ejudge.kreosoft.ru/en while I was a SWE student at TSU, Russia (2019-2020). Some code files may contain a dotted line as a separator between different versions of accepted solutions. The code is for the large part in C++14, but there are some solutions that were written in Python 3. The solution files are numbered according to the task's number on the online judge ejudge.

I hope you find them interesting!
